                Gianna Rappa is a creative artist, dancer, and traveler born and raised in Winter Garden, Florida.
                The 20-year-old found her passion for dancing at only 5 years old. Since then, she has not
                stopped dancing for a second, and can still be seen dancing away.

                Most of Gianna’s family lives in the surrounding Orlando area, from Winter Park to Millenia. 
                Gianna made lots of friends in school at Windermere Preparatory School, Sunridge Middle School, and 
                West Orange High School. While at West Orange, she found her passion for graphic design and bonded 
                with her teacher and mentor, Susanna Jordan.

                a furniture and home decor store called Element by Shangri-La. She got to apply her love for 
                graphic design to her work along with photography, videography, editing, and more.

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
                After graduation, Gianna wishes to get a social media job in the Tampa/St. Pete area. She hopes 
                to live with her best friend in the Lakeland area and explore the surrounding cities for the next year or so.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gianna’s professional goal is to start a company that helps small businesses begin their social media presence. 
                She wants to work for a couple of small businesses at a time, and once they have a good start with their digital 
                media advertising, recommend social media managers to take over or allow the company to manage it themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                She hopes to continue this pathway for as long as she can and continue learning about advertising and social media while doing so.
